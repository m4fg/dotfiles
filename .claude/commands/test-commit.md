# Test and Commit

Please follow these steps:

1. Run all tests using `npm test`
2. If tests pass, check for linting issues with `npm run lint`
3. If both pass, create a commit with a descriptive message
4. Show me the test results and commit hash

Make sure to stop if any step fails and show me the error.
